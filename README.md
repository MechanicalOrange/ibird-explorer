# ibird Explorer

 [[Demo](https://iassetsorg.github.io/ibird-explorer/)]
## Description

**ibird Explorer** is an open-source tool that allows users to retrieve and read messages and content from the ibird.io social media platform, even when the website is offline. Powered by Hedera Hashgraph, ibird.io stores all user actions, including posts, comments, likes, and follows, securely on the Hedera network. Each post has a unique hash on Hedera, enabling users to prove ownership of their content.

With ibird Explorer, users can enter the hash of a message or content item, and the tool will fetch and display the corresponding message directly from the Hedera Network. This ensures that users have permanent access to their content, regardless of the availability of the ibird.io website.

## Features

- Retrieve messages and content from the ibird.io platform using their unique Hedera Hashgraph hashes.
- Explore and read posts, even if the ibird.io website is offline.
- Verify ownership of content through the unique Hedera hashes associated with each item.
- An open-source and community-driven project, ensuring transparency and security.
